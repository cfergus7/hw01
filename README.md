## Description

1. After inspecting the website the biggest thing I noticed was the functionality was not all in place. An id was missing to the search-engine-optimization anchor.

2. To make the webpage more accessible I changed a ton of <div> tags.
    ⋅⋅* div to header
    ⋅⋅* div to nav
    ⋅⋅* div to section
    ⋅⋅* div to article
    ⋅⋅* div to aside
    ⋅⋅* div to article
    ⋅⋅* div to footer

3. Changing Classes to help on the CSS sheet was a huge task as well. This kept things D.R.Y.
    ..*class=search-engine-optimization   was changed to class=corevalues
    ..*class=online-reputation-management   was changed to class=corevalues
    ..*class=social-media-marketing   was changed to class=corevalues
    ..*class=Lead Generation   was changed to class=article
    ..*class=Brand Awareness   was changed to class=article
    ..*class=Cost Management   was changed to class=article

4. Changing the CSS sheet to reflect  the changes made to the HTML
    ..* .header to header
    ..* .header nav to header nav
    ..*.header nav a to header nav a
    ..* consolidating search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, social-media-marketing to .corvalues
    ..* .benefits class consolidation 
    ..* .article class consolidation

5. To speed up the load in time I resized all the images which cut down how much data had to be transfered before you could look at the site.
